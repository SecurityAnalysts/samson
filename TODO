CURRENT
---------------
0.1.0
===============
Goals:
    * Everything works
    * Document everything
    * Test everything

X   Finish PCG
X   Clean up the organization of padding schemes
X   Add documentation comments
X   Fix CRIME/BREACH (clean up and better results)
X   Make Bitstring sane... (use something like TDD)

X   Clean up code/make interfaces more uniform
    X   Choose bitlength or bytelength convention (look at Rijndael)
    X   Decide whether to use functions or objects
    X   Everything should return Bytes
    X   Fix all "TODOs"


X   Add NTRU tests
