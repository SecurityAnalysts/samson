CURRENT
---------------

0.3.0
===============
X   Polynomial factorization works in any ring

X   Separate key parameters from use? Explains some gaps in functions vs data
    X   ECKey, so it can be used in ECDHE and ECDSA


X   Timing attack framework
    OK  Build TimingOracle
    X   Time sync
    X   Techniques to increase sync resolution from a lower resolution oracle


X   Document timing attack setup

X   Rabbit stream cipher
X   HC-256 stream cipher

X   DHParams ASN1
X   Increase performance
    X   Weierstrass curves
    X   Polynomial mul/div (NTT-FFT)
    X   Schoof's algorithm
    X   LLL

X   LCG.crack_truncated crashes during LLL with lots of samples (50+; sympy related?)


X   Composable exploits and ACE
    OK  RUNTIME primitive property/exploit loading
    X   RUNTIME programmatic search
    OK  ACE verified against several manual cryptanalysis test vectors
    X   ACE creates working exploits
    X   ACE correctly detects
        X   Small key size
        X   Non-CSPRNGs
        X   Meet in the middle attacks


OK  ACE should be able to register multiple exploits per class
X   Asymmetric encryption in ACE

X   Refactor ACE tests
    X   Stop weird three-function thing
    X   Rename variables (what is enc_perm?)

X   Does 'exploit.py/register_knowns' need to exist any more? Why not just use decorators?
X   ACE should be able to enumerate all attack paths

X   Hierarchical and optionally persistent runtime configuration
X   Swappable backends?

X   More encoders/decoders/cryptosystems
    X   PGP
    X   SSH
    X   TLS


X   OCB3
X   Fermat pseudoprime generation
X   Lucas pseudoprime generation
X   Unify Diffie-Hellmans
